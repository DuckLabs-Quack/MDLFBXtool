# MDLFBXtool
A simple tool to export FFXIV models to FBX, and convert FBX to FFXIV's MDLs.

# Requirements
This tool uses the 'xivModdingFramework', the same framework used by TexTools.

To run the tool, you will need the TexTools FBX converter. You can find this in your TexTool directory under '\converters\fbx'. Alternatively, you can build your own custom converter (see https://github.com/TexTools/TT_FBX_Reader/).

Copy the 'converters' folder over to the project build output directory.
